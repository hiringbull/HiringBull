# React Native/Expo Project

You are an expert in TypeScript, React Native, Expo, and Mobile UI development with Nativewind.

Every time you choose to apply a rule(s), explicitly state the rule(s) in the output. You can abbreviate the rule description to a single word or phrase.

## Project Context

## Code Style and Structure

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError)
- Ensure components are modular, reusable, and maintainable.
- Component Modularity: Break down components into smaller, reusable pieces. Keep components focused on a single responsibility and shouldn't be more than 80 lines of code.
- To install new packages use `npx expo install <package-name>`
- Structure repository files as follows:

```
src
  ├── api   ## API related code, mainly using axios and react query
  ├── app   ## the main entry point for expo router(file-based routing), when you can find screens and navigation setup
  ├── components  ## shared components
  │   ├── card.tsx
  │   └── ui  ## core ui components. buttons, inputs, etc
  ├── lib  ## shared libraries, auth, env, hooks, i18n, storage, test-utils, utils
  ├── translations  ## translations files for the app
  ├── types  ## shared types

```

## Tech Stack

- Expo
- React Native
- TypeScript
- Nativewind ( Tailwind CSS for React Native )
- Expo Router
- React Query with React Query Kit
- Zustand
- React Native Keyboard Controller
- React Native SVG
- React Native MMKV

## Naming Conventions

- Favor named exports for components and utilities
- Use kebabCase for all files names and directories (e.g., visa-form.tsx)

## TypeScript Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer types over interfaces
- Avoid enums; use const objects with 'as const' assertion
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces
- Define strict types for message passing between different parts of the extension
- Use absolute imports for all files @/...
- Avoid try/catch blocks unless there's good reason to translate or handle error in that abstraction
- Use explicit return types for all functions

## State Management

- Use React Zustand for global state management
- Implement proper cleanup in useEffect hooks

## Syntax and Formatting

- Use "function" keyword for pure functions
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals
- Use declarative JSX
- Implement proper TypeScript discriminated unions for message types

## UI Design Guidelines

### Reference Files

- Onboarding style: `src/app/onboarding.tsx` - Clean, minimal selection UI pattern
- Main app screens follow the same pattern with green accent

### Design Principles

- Light, clean, minimal - avoid visual clutter
- White/light backgrounds (`bg-white`, `bg-neutral-100`)
- Generous whitespace and padding
- Rounded corners (`rounded-xl` for cards/buttons/inputs)
- Icons: Ionicons outline style, keep them subtle (not prominent)
- Emojis can be used for visual interest where appropriate

### Color System (from `src/components/ui/colors.js`)

| Color                | Usage                                                         |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `primary-*` (green)  | Main app accent: buttons, active tabs, selections, highlights |
| `secondary-*` (blue) | Onboarding flows, special actions                             |
| `neutral-*`          | Text, backgrounds, borders                                    |
| `danger-*`           | Destructive actions, errors                                   |
| `warning-*`          | Warnings                                                      |
| `success-*`          | Success states                                                |

**IMPORTANT:** Always use semantic color names (`primary-500`, `secondary-500`). Never hardcode hex values or use Tailwind defaults like `blue-500` or `green-500`.

### Button Component (`@/components/ui/Button`)

Use the Button component with these variants:

- `default` - Primary green button (main CTAs)
- `secondary` - Blue button (onboarding, special flows)
- `outline` - Green outlined button
- `outline-secondary` - Blue outlined button
- `destructive` - Red button for destructive actions
- `ghost` - Transparent with subtle text
- `link` - Text link style

Sizes: `sm`, `default`, `lg`

### Standard UI Patterns

- **Selection cards:** `rounded-xl border-2 p-4`, colored border + bg when selected
- **Full-width buttons:** Use `<Button size="lg" />` for main CTAs
- **Inputs:** `rounded-xl border border-neutral-200 bg-neutral-100 px-4 py-3`
- **Typography:** `text-3xl font-bold` for headings, `text-neutral-500` for muted text
- **Screen containers:** `bg-white dark:bg-neutral-900` with `px-6` horizontal padding

### Don'ts

- No heavy shadows or gradients
- No bright/loud colors outside the defined palette
- No overly prominent icons - keep them secondary to content
- No hardcoded color values - always use the color system

## UI and Styling

- Use Nativewind for styling and components
- Use built-in ui components such as Button, Input from `@components/ui`
- Ensure high accessibility (a11y) standards using ARIA roles and native accessibility props.
- Leverage react-native-reanimated and react-native-gesture-handler for performant animations and gestures.
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders by memoizing components and using useMemo and useCallback hooks appropriately.
- Make sure to use defined colors and fonts in the tailwind config file.

Here is a simple example of how a component should be written using :

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';

import { Text, View, Image, SavaAreaView } from '@/components/ui';

// Props should be defined in the top of the component
type Props = {
  text: string;
};

export function Title({ text }: Props) {
  return (
    <View className="flex-row items-center justify-center  py-4 pb-2">
      <Text className="pr-2 text-2xl">{text}</Text>
      <View className="h-[2px] flex-1 bg-neutral-300" />

      <Image
        source={require('@assets/images/demo.png')}
        style={{ width: 24, height: 24 }}
        contentFit="contain"
      />
    </View>
  );
}
```

## Error Handling

- Log errors appropriately for debugging
- Provide user-friendly error messages

## Testing

- Write unit tests using Jest and React Native Testing Library.
- Write unit tests for utilities and complex components
- The test file should be named like the component file but with the .test.tsx extension (e.g., component-name.test.tsx)
- Do not write unit tests for simple components that only show data

## Git Usage

Commit Message Prefixes:

- "fix:" for bug fixes
- "feat:" for new features
- "perf:" for performance improvements
- "docs:" for documentation changes
- "style:" for formatting changes
- "refactor:" for code refactoring
- "test:" for adding missing tests
- "chore:" for maintenance tasks

Rules:

- Use lowercase for commit messages
- Keep the summary line concise with a maximum of 100 characters
- Reference issue numbers when applicable

## Documentation

- Maintain clear README with the following sections:
  - Setup ( how to install and run the project )
  - Usage ( listing all the commands and how to use them )
  - Stack ( the tech stack used in the project )
  - Folder Structure ( the folder structure of the project only the important ones inside src )
